### Scratch Basketball
The project is a disabled basket ball player where the user (Player) enters their name, the game then resets and a 60 second clock starts counting down. The player is given on screen instructions prior to the clock starting the count down. Once the game starts the player moves from left to right across the screen horizontally, when the user thinks that the player is sufficiently in front of the basket they can press the space bar on the keyboard. Pressing the space bar will initiate a shoot and if the player was close enough to the centre of the basket they will score.  Once the whilst in the zone the user can initiate as many shoots as they can thus increasing their score. Once the 60 seconds is up the user will be told their score and the game will end.
